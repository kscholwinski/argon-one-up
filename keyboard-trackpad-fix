For backers who received the Shell Only version: please note that your config.txt is not yet configured, unlike the pre-assembled CM5 Laptop Core Units. You must connect an external USB mouse and keyboard for the first-time installation, as the laptop's built-in keyboard and trackpad will not work until the settings below are applied.

To enable the keyboard, trackpad, and external antenna, follow these steps:

1. Open the terminal and type:
sudo nano /boot/firmware/config.txt
 

2. Scroll to the bottom of the file.

3. Under the [all] section, add these exact lines:

dtparam=uart0=on

dtoverlay=dwc2,dr_mode=host

dtparam=pciex1_gen=3

usb_max_current_enable=1

dtparam=ant2

4. To Save: Press Ctrl + O, then press Enter.

5. To Exit: Press Ctrl + X.

6. To Finish: Type sudo reboot and press Enter.
