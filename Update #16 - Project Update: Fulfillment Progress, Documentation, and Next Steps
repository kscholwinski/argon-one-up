We want to take a moment to sincerely thank all of you for the continued support and patience. Over the past weeks, our team has been fully focused on fulfilling rewards, and a significant part of that work has been the very time-consuming process of handling custom keyboard requests from Kickstarter backers.

These custom keyboards were offered specifically to honor the spirit of the Kickstarter campaign and the early trust you placed in us. However, due to the operational complexity involved, this is something we may not be able to support in future production runs.

We also want to apologize for the lack of complete documentation at the moment. This is precisely why we are posting updates here on Kickstarter—you are currently the only group with access to the Argon ONE UP, and we want to communicate directly and transparently with you as things evolve.

That said, we have already started building out our official documentation. Our wiki is now live and will continue to grow:

In parallel, we will be publishing more software and firmware information on GitHub, and future technical discussions, community feedback, and shared solutions will be centralized through our forum:

Regarding shipping: for specific shipment concerns or address-related questions, please message us privately. Shipments are being processed by region rather than by backer number, so even if you see others receiving their rewards ahead of you, please be assured that your unit is in the pipeline and will be sent out. We apologize if you have not yet received your reward and appreciate your understanding as we work through regional logistics.

Once again, thank you for your patience, trust, and support. This project would not be possible without the Kickstarter community, and we’re excited to continue building and improving the Argon ONE UP together with you.

— The Argon40 Team
