There was a misprint in the Quick Start Guide that came with the initial shipment of Argon ONE UP on how to run the Argon ONE UP Script.

The correct command that you need to type in the Terminal to run the Script is: 

               curl https://download.argon40.com/argononeup.sh | bash

This script works for the Raspberry Pi OS.
