February 9, 2026

We’ve made an improvement to make it easier for our Kickstarter backers to engage with us and with each other on the Argon 40 Forum.

Normally, new forum users are required to go through a vouching and credential verification process before they can post or comment. For our Kickstarter backers, we’ve removed this extra step.

By using the invite link below, you will be able to register and immediately post, comment, and participate in the forum—even as a new user:

👉 https://forum.argon40.com/invites/KaBPELxvUt

To help us keep the forum focused, constructive, and spam-free, this invite link is intended exclusively for Kickstarter backers. Please do not share this link publicly or outside of the backer community, as unrestricted sharing may result in abuse and could require us to disable instant access.

This forum will be our primary place for:

    Sharing updates and technical notes
    Answering questions from backers
    Community discussions, tips, and user contributions
    Early documentation and guidance, especially while full docs are still being finalized

We encourage all backers to join, ask questions, and share feedback. Your participation helps shape ongoing support and future improvements.

Thank you again for your continued support and for being part of the Argon 40 community.
