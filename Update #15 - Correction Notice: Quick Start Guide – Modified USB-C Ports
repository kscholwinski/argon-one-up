We would like to formally notify users of a misprint in the Quick Start Guide regarding the functionality of the two adjacent modified USB-C ports.

These ports are purpose-built to support the dedicated 40-pin GPIO module and are not intended for general USB-C use.

The correct specifications are as follows:

The primary and intended function of these two USB-C ports is GPIO expansion via the special 40-pin GPIO module.

 - Only one of the two ports supports USB data transmission.

 - The supported data connection is limited to USB 2.0 speeds.

To address this, a revised PDF version of the Quick Start Guide has been uploaded and is available at the following official resources:

These documentation resources will be continually updated to reflect the latest corrections, clarifications, and community feedback.

We regret any confusion caused by this documentation error and appreciate your understanding. Thank you for your continued support and cooperation.
